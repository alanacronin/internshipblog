    <ul>
      <li>Had a call with Stewart and talked about the sounds and what he expected from me in terms of sound</li>
      <li>Got started straight away with some progress sound effects, which were music sound effects for when the player progresses in their training and also did correct/incorrect sound effects. </li>
      <li>This was very fun, I used Reaper to create the sounds and sourced sounds from Freesound, which you can find sounds you donâ€™t have to attribute to the creator </li>
      <li>I made some progress/level up and right/wrong answer sounds for the training videos, and loopable background noise for when the player is standing in or outside of the aircraft. </li>
    </ul>
