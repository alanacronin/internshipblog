    <strong class="red">Notes and Reflection</strong>

    <ul>
      <li>Some of the sound effects I submitted had too much silence at the start/end of the clips and accidentally submitted the whole Reaper file for one of the effects so I fixed all that, luckily I had everything saved in the right place and was able to this really quickly in the morning so I could proceed onto my next task</li>
      <li>After learning I was confident in HTML/CSS and Git, Stewart tasked me with learning Hugo. I thought I would be offered by Stewart to teach me Hugo as I said I wasnâ€™t familiar with it. It took me a while to learn it by myself and while I think I am pretty confident with it now there is still a lot more to learn, the layout compared to plain HTML/CSS/Java is completely different and it uses an additional language that I was not familiar with, GO. But I persevered and took initiative and listened to some Youtube videos, read some articles and was able to teach myself.</li>
    </ul>
